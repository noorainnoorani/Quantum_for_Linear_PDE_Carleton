To use "PennylaneNoiseModel_BlockInsert.ipynb", please insert its contents
into your code to create the noisy device, dev_noisy.

You can then run your quantum circuits on dev_noisy to simulate having that noise.

Make sure to define the number of wires first, as the code needs that parameter 
to define a device (the variable that corresponds to the number of qubits/wires is
n_wires, in the file. You can change it to whatever you desire.
